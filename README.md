# Project Summary: Document Management System (DMS)

The project aims to implement a Document Management System (DMS), a centralized repository for managing documents. Users are divided into three groups: System Administrators, Document Administrators, and Clients. The system comprises three applications:

1. **Frontend React App for Document Management:** A web application for managing documents.
2. **Frontend React App for User Management:** A web application for managing user accounts.
3. **Backend Spring Boot App:** Handles the business logic and data storage.

## Features:

- **User Management (Users Application):** System administrators can manage user accounts, assign root directories for clients, and set access privileges.

- **Document Management (Documents Application):** Clients can manage documents within their directory tree, while Document Administrators have additional capabilities like creating and deleting directories.

- **Authentication:** Two-factor authentication is implemented, with a unique token generated by a mobile application serving as the second step. Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users access to both applications with one set of credentials. OAuth2 framework is utilized for external login into the Documents application.

- **Security Measures:** Protection against common web application attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, Session Hijacking, and DoS attacks. Error handling ensures system-specific information remains obscured from end-users.

- **Activity Monitoring:** The system monitors directory and file activities, notifying the System Administrator of any deletions.

## Additional Information:

Keycloak server is employed for SSO and other security features. To utilize these features, setting up Keycloak server is necessary.
